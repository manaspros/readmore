# Context Clues
Covalence

## Info
* You and your friends were attending a grand dinner party when tragedy struck
* Accusations are running rampant to determine who committed the crime
* You will be building a webpage that will display 100 accusations on the screen
* When an accusation is clicked, an alert will appear that shows the full text of the accusation
* Knowledge of closure and the modulus operator will be useful in this lab
* To force your hand at trying closure, you must not use let/const in this lab. Only use var.

## Getting Started
* Create an index.html, script.js, and a css file for styling

## Objectives
* When the page first loads, insert h2 elements onto the page
    * The h3 elements should simply say Accusation 1, Accusation 2, Accusation 3, ... Accusation 100
    * Clicking on an button beneath h3 element should display an alert that says a statement
* Get the data of h3 from a database stored in json file.
